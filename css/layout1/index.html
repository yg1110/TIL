                <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a
                    metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia,its history going
                    back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
                <p>London, also referred to as Greater London, is one of 9 regions of England and the top-level
                    subdivision covering most of the city's metropolis. The small ancient City of London at its core
                    once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the Corporation of London resisted
                    attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs, causing "London" to be defined in a number ways
                    for different purposes.</p>
